# .EXE-to-.lnk-shortcut-
Converts executables to shortcuts which can run your file.

This tool is intended for only educational purposes only.

# About

This script is written in Python 3.8. It's written completely by me.

This basically is a Dropper. It just downloads the file and executes it upon download.

# Functionality

What this program basically does is create a shortcut and then edits the Target location and adds arguments which allows it to run PowerShell and execute commands.


# Use

First you should upload your .exe to a server where you can download it using a direct link.

1. Enter the direct link of your file.

2. Enter the location where you want your exe to be dropped (The shortcut will always be dropped on desktop unless you change the code.)

3. Enter the file name of the exe you want to drop.

4. You'll find a shortcut on the desktop which will should download & execute your exe! :)
